# Widgetpad firmware

Firmware for the [Widgetpad](https://github.com/widget-/widgetpad) ITG
dance pad.

The firmware was originally based on [Bandit](https://github.com/andlehma)'s
[bttp-firmware](https://github.com/BanditsTerrificTravelPad/bttp-firmware),
but has since been rewritten.

## Requirements

This firmware is currently for the Teensy 3.2, but will be updated for
the [Teensy 4.0](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html).

The following software is needed to build the firmware:

* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
* [Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html)

Teensyduino carries its own version requirement for the Arduino IDE.

The following software may be required, as I haven't tested without it:

* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Arduino plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.vscode-arduino)
  for VS Code
